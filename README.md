# Data Science Project as a SUPER BEGINNER 📊
In this data science project, I aim to predict housing prices based on various features using regression techniques. The dataset used for this project is the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" from Kaggle. As a beginner in data science, I will explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and apply basic regression models to predict house prices accurately. 🏠💰

## Overview 📝
Data Understanding 🧐: I will start by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, including the different features, their descriptions, and their potential impact on house prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis 📊: I will explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, relationships, and potential outliers. This analysis will help me understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

Data Preprocessing 🧹: To prepare the data for modeling, I will handle missing values, address outliers if present, and transform categorical variables into numerical representations. Additionally, I will perform feature scaling or normalization as needed.

Feature Selection 🎯: I will identify relevant features that significantly influence house prices. This step involves analyzing feature correlations, conducting statistical tests, and considering domain knowledge to select the most informative features.

Regression Modeling 📈: As a beginner, I will start with basic regression models such as linear regression. I will fit the model using a subset of features and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.

Model Evaluation and Refinement 🔄: I will assess the performance of the regression model using techniques like cross-validation and learning curves. Based on the evaluation results, I will refine the model by experimenting with different subsets of features, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.

Prediction and Interpretation 🎯: Finally, I will make predictions on unseen data and interpret the results. I will examine the coefficients or feature importances to identify the most influential factors affecting house prices.
